# Target contract (single pool) â€” IGNORED when POOLS is defined.
# Leave empty or set to a placeholder if using POOLS.
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddressHere

# Multi-pool configuration (single chain)
# When POOLS is set, CONTRACT_ADDRESS is ignored by the code.
# Provide an array of pools with:
# - address: checksummed 0x address
# - name: human-friendly name (used in Telegram messages)
# - decimals: token decimals used for formatting amounts (e.g., 6 for USDC/USDT, 18 for ETH-like)
# Example (edit to your pools, add/remove entries as needed):
POOLS=[{"address":"0xYourPoolAddressHere","name":"Your Pool Name","decimals":6}]

# Optional decoding configuration
# Provide ONE of the following to enable decoded messages:
# - EVENT_SIGNATURE: full canonical signature without spaces (e.g., Deposit(address,uint256))
# - EVENT_ABI_JSON: minimal JSON ABI array containing the event definition
# If both are empty, the app will send raw logs with topics/data.
